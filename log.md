**Today's Progress**: Tried fixing my "Free UI Kit" page for my "Seoul Bike" UX case study. Read it here: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/seoul-bike-case-study-6ac4172f7188

**Thoughts:** I struggled with linking errors from improperly linking the images and CSS in the HTML. Need to work on the CSS which will be quite difficult, but not impossible

**Link to work:** Not officially published yet.
